# TitrationPlotter

This program is made to plot pH during the titration with considering the data you provide.

This is built with Python 3.13.1. To use this program, you have to activate it from [Python Official Release](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The csv file to hand to the program must be in the following format and not have any heading rows. Otherwise the program throws an error and no plot.

```csv
[titrated volume of the base],[pH value]
[titrated volume of the base],[pH value]
...
```
